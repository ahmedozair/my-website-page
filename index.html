	<P1> The passage experienced a surge in 
	popularity duringthe 1960s when Letraset used
	it on their dry-transfer sheets, and again during 
	the 90s as desktop publishers bundled the text with their 
	software. Today it's seen allaround the web; on templates, 
	websites, and stock designs.Use our generator to get your own,

	 <h3>About</h3>
	  <p2>  The French lettering
	  company Letraset manufactured a set of 
	  dry-transfer sheets  which included the lorem 
	  ipsum filler text in a variety of fonts, sizes,
	  and layouts. These sheets of lettering could
	  be rubbed onanywhere and were quickly adopted 
	  by graphic artists, printers, architects, and 
	  advertisers for their professional look and ease
	  of use.  </p2>

	  <p3>  Second, use lorem ipsum if you think the
	  placeholder text will be too distracting. For 
	  specific projects, collaboration between copywritersand
	  designers may be best, however, like Karen McGrane 
	  said, draft copy has a way  of turning any meeting aboutlayout decisions into a
	  discussion about word choice.So don't be afraid. </p3>
